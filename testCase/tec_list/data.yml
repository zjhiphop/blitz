              A CSS object consists of four things：
              HTML, which can be one or more nodes of the DOM,
              CSS declarations about the style of those nodes all of which begin with the class name of the wrapper node
              Components like background images and sprites required for display, and
              JavaScript behaviors, listeners, or methods associated with the object.

             Flatiron promotes code organization and sustainability by clearly 
             separating development concerns. Each component works elegantly with or without 
             its counterparts. Many of the components work the same in the browser as they 
             do on the server.This is the motivation behind flatiron. At it's core flatiron is two things:
             1) an initiative to build a collection of decoupled tools with the same standard of quality and performance that you would expect from anything built by nodejitsu. 
             2) a full-stack web application development framework which packages these tools together to make isomorphic and stream-based application development easier.

            The Deconstructed series is designed to visually and interactively deconstruct the internal code 
            of JavaScript libraries, including jQuery, Prototype and MooTools.
            It breaks the physical JavaScript into visual blocks that you can easiliy navigate. 
            Each block opens to reveal its internal code. Clickable hyperlinks allow you to follow program flow.
